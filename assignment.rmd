I
Generate samples
`r samples <- rnorm(30, 18.5, 0.5)`

Null hypothesis - the population mean is smaller or equal to 20
Alternative hypothesis - the population mean is greater than 20
Confidence level 0.9
`r t.test(samples, alternative = "g", mu = 20, conf.level = 0.9)`

Result: cannot reject the null hypothesis

II
Generate samples
`r samples <- rnorm(49, 53.1, 10)`

Null hypothesis - the population mean is smaller or equal to 50
Alternative hypothesis - the population mean is greater than 50
Confidence level 0.9
`r t.test(samples, alternative = "g", mu = 50, conf.level = 0.9)`

Result: the null hypothesis can be rejected at 0.1 significance level 

III
Variance: `r variance = 200`
Standard deviation: `r stdev = sqrt(variance)`
Generate samples
`r samples <- rnorm(100, 40, stdev)`

Null hypothesis - the population mean is equals 40
Alternative hypothesis - the population mean differs from 40
`r t.test(samples, mu = 40, conf.level = 0.9)`

Result: the null hypothesis can be rejected at 0.1 significance level
